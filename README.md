## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I need to use chiaroscuro shading when drawing my dragon?
A: No!
Q: Should I give my dragon a name?
A: Yes. You shall name him Trogdor.
Q: What if my dragon doesn't look as good as the other students' drawings?
A: Don't worry about them. They wouldn't know majesty if it came up and bit them in the face.

## Plans for Future Development

Currently working on a new module that lets you release your Trogdor dragon into the countryside where it will burninate the peasants and their thatched roof COTTAGES!!!
